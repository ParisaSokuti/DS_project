# Sentinel will rewrite this file with additional configuration
# Generated entries will appear below this line

# =================================================================
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# 
# 1. Sentinel requires at least 3 instances for proper quorum
# 2. The quorum is set to 2 (need 2 sentinels to agree on failover)
# 3. Failover timeout is 10 seconds
# 4. Down-after-milliseconds is 5 seconds (time to declare master down)
# 5. Only 1 replica can sync with new master at a time (parallel-syncs)
