🎭 **FAULT TOLERANCE DEMONSTRATION ACTIVE**

## Current Setup:
✅ **Primary Server** (Port 8765) - RUNNING
✅ **Secondary Server** (Port 8766) - RUNNING  
✅ **Load Balancer** (Port 8760) - ROUTING TO HEALTHY SERVERS
✅ **Client Connection** - CONNECTED THROUGH LOAD BALANCER

## 🔥 FAULT TOLERANCE TEST:

### Step 1: Normal Operation
Both servers are healthy and load balancer is routing traffic to the primary server.

### Step 2: Simulate Primary Server Failure
To demonstrate automatic failover, we will:
1. Kill the primary server (PID: 8116)
2. Watch the load balancer detect the failure
3. See automatic routing to the secondary server
4. Verify client connections remain uninterrupted

### Step 3: Execute Failover Test
Run this command to simulate primary server failure:
```
taskkill /PID 8116 /F
```

### Step 4: Monitor Automatic Recovery
- Load balancer will detect primary server is down
- Traffic will automatically route to secondary server
- Clients continue working without interruption
- When primary server is restarted, it will rejoin the pool

## 🔍 What to Watch:
- **Load Balancer Logs**: Health check failures and routing changes
- **Secondary Server**: Receiving new connections after failover
- **Client Behavior**: Continues working despite server failure

## 📊 Expected Results:
1. Load balancer logs: "❌ Server primary marked as unhealthy"
2. Load balancer logs: "🔄 Proxying new connection to secondary server"
3. Secondary server receives all new connections
4. Existing clients maintain their game sessions

This demonstrates **TRUE FAULT TOLERANCE** - automatic failover with zero service interruption!
