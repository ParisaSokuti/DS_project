# Single-Session Enforcement Implementation

## Summary

I have successfully implemented single-session enforcement to prevent multiple simultaneous connections for the same user account. This addresses the issue where 4 clients could all connect as "kasra" at the same time.

## Changes Made

### 1. Server-Side Authentication Manager (`backend/game_auth_manager.py`)

**Updated authentication methods** to check for existing active connections:

#### Login Handler (`_handle_login`)
- **Before authentication**: Check if `player_id` already exists in `self.player_sessions`
- **If exists**: Ping the existing WebSocket to verify it's still active
- **If active**: Reject new connection with `ALREADY_CONNECTED` error
- **If dead**: Clean up dead connection and allow new one

#### Registration Handler (`_handle_register`)
- Same logic applied to registration to prevent edge cases

#### Token Authentication Handler (`_handle_token_auth`)
- Same logic applied to token-based authentication

#### New Cleanup Method (`_cleanup_player_session`)
- Properly removes both `authenticated_players` and `player_sessions` mappings
- Provides logging for debugging

### 2. Client-Side Authentication Manager (`backend/client_auth_manager.py`)

**Updated authentication response handling** to properly handle rejection:

#### Error Handling for `ALREADY_CONNECTED`
- Detects `error_code: 'ALREADY_CONNECTED'` in server responses
- Displays user-friendly message explaining the situation
- Provides clear instructions:
  1. Close the other session/window where connected
  2. Wait a few seconds for connection timeout
  3. Try connecting again

#### Applied to All Authentication Methods
- Login handler (`handle_login`)
- Registration handler (`handle_register`)  
- Token authentication handler (`authenticate_with_token`)

## How It Works

### Connection Tracking
```python
# Server maintains two mappings:
self.authenticated_players = {}  # websocket -> player_info
self.player_sessions = {}        # player_id -> websocket
```

### Enforcement Logic
1. **New connection attempt** for existing user
2. **Check existing session**: Look up `player_id` in `player_sessions`
3. **Ping test**: If found, ping existing WebSocket to verify it's alive
4. **Decision**:
   - If alive: Reject new connection with informative error
   - If dead: Clean up dead connection, allow new one

### Error Response Format
```json
{
    "success": false,
    "message": "User kasra is already connected from another session. Please disconnect from the other session first.",
    "error_code": "ALREADY_CONNECTED"
}
```

### Client Handling
```
ðŸš« User kasra is already connected from another session. Please disconnect from the other session first.

ðŸ’¡ To connect from this session:
   1. Close the other session/window where you're connected
   2. Wait a few seconds for the connection to timeout
   3. Try connecting again

Returning to authentication menu...
```

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Account Sharing**: Each user account can only have one active session
2. **Resource Protection**: Prevents abuse through multiple connections
3. **Game Integrity**: Ensures one player per account in games
4. **User-Friendly**: Clear error messages guide users on how to resolve conflicts
5. **Dead Connection Cleanup**: Automatically handles stale connections

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Dead Connections**: Ping test identifies and cleans up dead WebSockets
2. **Network Issues**: Timeout on ping indicates dead connection
3. **Server Restart**: Fresh server state allows reconnections
4. **Graceful Disconnects**: Proper cleanup when connections close normally

## Testing

The implementation can be tested by:

1. **Start server**: `python backend/server.py`
2. **Connect first client**: `python backend/client.py` (login as kasra)
3. **Try second client**: `python backend/client.py` (login as kasra again)
4. **Expected result**: Second connection rejected with helpful error message

## Impact on Original Issue

**Before**: 4 clients could all connect as "kasra" simultaneously
**After**: Only 1 client can connect as "kasra" at a time

This ensures that each user account maintains a single active gaming session, preventing confusion and maintaining game integrity.
