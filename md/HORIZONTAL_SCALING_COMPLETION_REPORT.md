- **Rollback Capability**: Automatic rollback on scaling failures

### ✅ Scaling Metrics & Triggers

#### Performance Thresholds:
```yaml
Emergency Scaling (High Priority):
- CPU Usage > 90% for 1 minute → Immediate scale up
- Memory Usage > 85% for 1 minute → Immediate scale up
- Error Rate > 5% for 2 minutes → Scale up

Game-Specific Scaling:
- Players per instance > 100 for 3 minutes → Scale up  
- Game creation rate > 10/minute for 2 minutes → Scale up
- Player queue length > 20 for 1 minute → Scale up

Resource Optimization:
- CPU Usage < 20% for 10 minutes → Scale down
- Players per instance < 20 for 15 minutes → Scale down
```

#### Scaling Behavior:
- **Minimum Instances**: 2 (high availability)
- **Maximum Instances**: 20 (cost control)
- **Scale Up Amount**: 1-3 instances based on urgency
- **Scale Down Amount**: 1-2 instances (conservative)
- **Cooldown Period**: 5-15 minutes between scaling operations

### ✅ Deployment Configurations

#### 1. **Docker Compose** (Development/Staging)
```yaml
services:
  load-balancer:    # HAProxy with WebSocket support
  hokm-server-1:    # Game server instance 1
  hokm-server-2:    # Game server instance 2
  auto-scaler:      # Auto-scaling service
  redis-master:     # Redis primary
  redis-replica:    # Redis replica
  prometheus:       # Metrics collection
  grafana:         # Monitoring dashboard
```

#### 2. **Kubernetes** (Production)
```yaml
components:
  - Deployment: hokm-server (2-20 replicas)
  - HPA: Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
  - Ingress: NGINX with WebSocket support
  - Service: Load balancer service
