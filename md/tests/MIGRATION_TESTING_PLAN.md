# Migration Testing Plan for Hokm Game Server
# From: Redis-only architecture
# To: Hybrid Redis+PostgreSQL architecture

## ðŸŽ¯ Migration Testing Overview

### Objectives
- Ensure zero data loss during migration
- Maintain game continuity for active sessions
- Validate performance improvements/stability
- Provide reliable rollback procedures
- Minimize user experience disruption

### Migration Phases
1. **Pre-Migration Testing** (Redis baseline)
2. **Migration Process Testing** (Data transfer validation)
3. **Post-Migration Testing** (Hybrid architecture validation)
4. **Performance Comparison** (Before vs After)
5. **Rollback Testing** (Emergency procedures)
6. **A/B Testing** (Gradual rollout validation)

## Phase 1: Pre-Migration Baseline Testing

### Test Categories:
- Performance baseline establishment
- Data consistency validation
- Active game state documentation
- System capacity measurements

### Key Metrics to Capture:
- Average response times for all operations
- Concurrent user capacity
- Memory usage patterns
- Redis operation throughput
- Active game states and player sessions

### Success Criteria:
- All baseline metrics documented
- No data corruption in Redis
- All active games properly tracked
- Performance benchmarks established

---

## Phase 2: Migration Process Testing

### Data Migration Validation:
- Player data migration accuracy
- Game session state preservation
- Statistics and leaderboard consistency
- WebSocket connection state handling

### Migration Process Steps:
1. **Snapshot Creation**: Full Redis backup
2. **Data Export**: Convert Redis data to SQL format
3. **PostgreSQL Import**: Bulk insert with validation
4. **Consistency Check**: Compare Redis vs PostgreSQL
5. **Sync Verification**: Real-time sync testing

### Critical Test Scenarios:
- Migration during active games
- Player reconnection during migration
- New game creation during migration
- Game completion during migration

---

## Phase 3: Post-Migration Testing

### Hybrid Architecture Validation:
- Dual-storage consistency
- Automatic failover testing
- Performance optimization validation
- Circuit breaker functionality

### Integration Testing:
- Redis-PostgreSQL synchronization
- Cache invalidation strategies
- Conflict resolution mechanisms
- Data recovery procedures

---

## Phase 4: Performance Comparison

### Metrics Comparison:
- Response time improvements
- Throughput capacity changes
- Memory usage optimization
- Database query performance
- Concurrent user handling

### Load Testing Scenarios:
- Baseline load replication
- Increased concurrent users
- Sustained operation testing
- Peak usage simulation

---

## Phase 5: Rollback Testing

### Rollback Scenarios:
- Complete rollback to Redis-only
- Partial rollback with data preservation
- Emergency rollback procedures
- Data consistency after rollback

### Validation Requirements:
- Zero data loss during rollback
- All active games preserved
- Player statistics maintained
- System stability confirmed

---

## Phase 6: A/B Testing Setup

### Traffic Splitting:
- 10% hybrid architecture
- 90% Redis-only (control group)
- Gradual increase: 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%

### Monitoring Points:
- User experience metrics
- Performance comparisons
- Error rates and stability
- Feature functionality validation

---

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Scenarios:
1. **Data Loss**: Comprehensive backup and validation
2. **Game Disruption**: Phased migration during low-usage periods
3. **Performance Degradation**: Immediate rollback capabilities
4. **System Instability**: Circuit breaker and failover mechanisms

### Contingency Plans:
- Immediate rollback procedures
- Emergency data recovery
- Alternative migration strategies
- Communication protocols for users
