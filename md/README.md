# Hokm Card Game - Distributed Server

A real-time multiplayer implementation of the Hokm card game with WebSocket communication, Redis persistence, and PostgreSQL database support.

## Project Overview

This project implements a complete Hokm (Persian card game) server with support for:
- Real-time multiplayer gameplay (4 players)
- WebSocket-based communication
- Player reconnection and session persistence
- Redis caching and game state management
- PostgreSQL database for persistent storage
- Circuit breaker patterns for resilience
- Horizontal scaling capabilities

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Redis Server
- PostgreSQL (optional, for persistence)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd DS_project
   ```

2. **Set up virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Start Redis (required)**
   ```bash
   redis-server
   ```

5. **Run the server**
   ```bash
   python backend/server.py
   ```

### Basic Usage

1. **Connect clients** to `ws://localhost:8765`

2. **Join a room** by sending:
   ```json
   {"type": "join", "room_code": "1234"}
   ```

3. **Game flow**:
   - 4 players join → Teams assigned → Hakem selected
   - Initial cards dealt (5 cards) → Hakem chooses hokm
   - Final cards dealt (13 cards each) → Gameplay begins
   - Players play cards following suit rules
   - Tricks completed → Rounds progress → Game completion

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Redis Configuration
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=

# PostgreSQL Configuration (optional)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/hokm_db

# Server Configuration
SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
SERVER_PORT=8765
```

### Redis Setup
The game requires Redis for state management:
```bash
# Start Redis with default configuration
redis-server

# Or with custom configuration
redis-server /path/to/redis.conf
```

### PostgreSQL Setup (Optional)
For persistent storage and advanced features:
```bash
# Create database
createdb hokm_db

# Run migrations
python database/setup.py
```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage. All tests are located in the `tests/` directory.

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
cd tests
python -m pytest

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest -k "reconnection"
python -m pytest -k "game_completion"

# Run with verbose output
python -m pytest -v

# Run load tests
python run_comprehensive_load_tests.py
```

### Test Categories
- **Core Game Tests**: Basic game logic and rules
- **Network Tests**: WebSocket communication and reliability
- **Reconnection Tests**: Player disconnection/reconnection scenarios
- **Database Tests**: PostgreSQL and Redis integration
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing and stress testing
- **Bug Fix Tests**: Regression testing for resolved issues

See `tests/README_TESTS.md` for detailed test documentation.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **GameServer** (`backend/server.py`)
   - WebSocket connection management
   - Game state coordination
   - Player session handling

2. **GameBoard** (`backend/game_board.py`)
   - Game logic implementation
   - Card dealing and validation
   - Scoring and progression

3. **NetworkManager** (`backend/network.py`)
   - WebSocket message routing
   - Broadcast mechanisms
   - Connection lifecycle management

4. **RedisManager** (`backend/redis_manager_resilient.py`)
   - Game state persistence
   - Session data management
   - Circuit breaker protection

### Communication Protocol

The server uses WebSocket with JSON messages:

```json
// Join game
{"type": "join", "room_code": "1234"}

// Select hokm
{"type": "hokm_selected", "room_code": "1234", "suit": "hearts"}

// Play card
{"type": "play_card", "room_code": "1234", "player_id": "...", "card": "A_hearts"}

// Reconnect
{"type": "reconnect", "player_id": "..."}
```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build

# Scale horizontally
docker-compose up --scale gameserver=3
```

### Kubernetes Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to Kubernetes
kubectl apply -f k8s-deployment.yml
```

### Production Configuration
- Enable Redis persistence
- Configure PostgreSQL connection pooling
- Set up load balancing
- Configure monitoring and logging

## Development

### Code Organization
- **Backend Logic**: `backend/` directory contains all server-side code
- **Database**: `database/` contains schemas and migrations
- **Tests**: `tests/` contains all test files with clear categorization
- **Configuration**: `config/` contains environment-specific settings
- **Scripts**: `scripts/` contains deployment and utility scripts

### Contributing
1. Follow the existing code structure
2. Add tests for new features
3. Update documentation
4. Ensure all tests pass
5. Follow the established naming conventions

### Debug Tools
Located in `tests/` directory:
- `debug_game_state.py` - Inspect game state
- `debug_connection_close.py` - Debug connection issues
- `debug_redis_storage.py` - Redis data inspection

## Performance

### Benchmarks
- **Concurrent Games**: Supports 100+ simultaneous games
- **Player Connections**: Handles 1000+ concurrent connections
- **Message Throughput**: 10,000+ messages/second
- **Reconnection Time**: <2 seconds average

### Optimization Features
- Connection pooling
- Message batching
- Redis pipeline operations
- Efficient game state serialization
- Memory usage optimization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Redis Connection Errors**
   ```bash
   # Check Redis status
   redis-cli ping
   # Should return PONG
   ```

2. **WebSocket Connection Issues**
   ```bash
   # Test WebSocket connectivity
   python tests/debug_connection_close.py
   ```

3. **Game State Issues**
   ```bash
   # Inspect game state
   python tests/debug_game_state.py
   ```

### Logging
Logs are available in:
- Console output (development)
- `server.log` (production)
- Redis logs (Redis operations)
