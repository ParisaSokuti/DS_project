# Hybrid Data Architecture Strategy
## Redis + PostgreSQL for Hokm Game Server

### 🎯 **Strategy Overview**

This document outlines a hybrid data architecture that leverages Redis for ultra-low latency game operations and PostgreSQL for reliable data persistence, creating an optimal gaming experience.

## 📊 **Data Distribution Strategy**

### 🔥 **Redis (Hot Data - Low Latency)**
*For real-time, frequently accessed, temporary data*

#### Game State Data
- **Active Game Sessions** (TTL: 4 hours)
  - Current game phase (waiting, playing, completed)
  - Player turns and actions queue
  - Card hands (encrypted)
  - Current trick state
  - Score tracking during gameplay
  - Timer states

#### Player Session Data  
- **WebSocket Connections** (TTL: 30 minutes)
  - Connection status and metadata
  - Room membership
  - Authentication tokens
  - Reconnection state

#### Real-time Caching
- **Frequently Accessed Data** (TTL: 15 minutes)
  - Player profiles for active users
  - Game room listings
  - Leaderboard snapshots
  - Recent game results

#### Pub/Sub Messaging
- **Real-time Communications**
  - Game events and notifications
  - Inter-server messages
  - Chat messages (temporary)
  - System alerts

### 🐘 **PostgreSQL (Cold Data - Persistent)**
*For long-term, analytical, and critical business data*

#### Core Business Data
- **Player Accounts**
  - User profiles and authentication
  - Account settings and preferences
  - Registration and verification data
  - Account status and permissions

#### Game History & Analytics
- **Completed Games**
  - Full game records and moves
  - Player performance statistics
  - Game duration and patterns
  - Tournament results

#### Persistent Configuration
- **System Configuration**
  - Game rules and settings
  - Server configuration
  - Feature flags
  - Maintenance schedules

#### Audit & Compliance
- **Audit Logs**
  - User actions and system events
  - Security events
  - Performance metrics history
  - Error logs and debugging data

## 🔄 **Data Flow Patterns**

### Pattern 1: Game Lifecycle
```
Game Start → Redis (active state) → Game End → PostgreSQL (permanent record)
                ↓                                        ↑
         Real-time updates                    Async persistence
```

### Pattern 2: Player Data
```
Login → PostgreSQL (auth) → Redis (session) → Logout → PostgreSQL (stats update)
```

### Pattern 3: Hybrid Queries
```
Dashboard → Redis (active games) + PostgreSQL (history) → Merged response
```

## ⚡ **Performance Optimization**

### Latency Targets
- **Redis Operations**: < 1ms average
- **PostgreSQL Operations**: < 20ms average
- **Hybrid Operations**: < 50ms total
- **Synchronization**: < 100ms async

### Caching Strategy
- **Write-Through**: Critical game events
- **Write-Behind**: Non-critical statistics
- **Cache-Aside**: Player profiles and leaderboards
- **Pub/Sub**: Real-time notifications

## 🔒 **Data Consistency Strategy**

### Eventual Consistency
- Game statistics and analytics
- Player achievement updates
- Leaderboard calculations
- Historical data aggregation

### Strong Consistency
- Player account balance (if applicable)
- Tournament standings
- Critical game state transitions
- Authentication and authorization

## 🚨 **Error Handling Strategy**

### Redis Failures
- **Circuit Breaker**: Automatic fallback to PostgreSQL
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue with reduced features
- **Cache Rebuilding**: Automatic recovery from PostgreSQL

### PostgreSQL Failures
- **Continue Playing**: Games continue in Redis-only mode
- **Delayed Persistence**: Queue writes for later replay
- **Player Notification**: Inform about potential data loss

### Synchronization Failures
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Store failed synchronizations
- **Manual Recovery**: Tools for data reconciliation

## 📈 **Scalability Considerations**

### Redis Scaling
- **Clustering**: Horizontal scaling for high throughput
- **Sharding**: By room ID or player ID
- **Read Replicas**: For read-heavy operations
- **Memory Management**: Optimized data structures

### PostgreSQL Scaling
- **Read Replicas**: For analytics and reporting
- **Connection Pooling**: pgBouncer for connection efficiency
- **Partitioning**: By date or game type
- **Indexing Strategy**: Optimized for gaming queries

## 🔧 **Implementation Priorities**

### Phase 1: Core Hybrid Architecture
1. Data access layer implementation
2. Basic synchronization mechanisms
3. Error handling and circuit breakers
4. Performance monitoring

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
1. Intelligent caching strategies
2. Real-time analytics
3. Advanced error recovery
4. Performance optimization

### Phase 3: Enterprise Features
1. Multi-region synchronization
2. Advanced monitoring and alerting
3. Automated scaling
4. Business intelligence integration

## 🎮 **Game-Specific Optimizations**

### Hokm Game Characteristics
- **4 Players per Game**: Optimal for Redis hash operations
- **13 Rounds per Game**: Structured data progression
- **Team-based Scoring**: Aggregate operations
- **Turn-based Play**: Sequential state updates

### Optimized Data Structures
- **Redis Hash**: Player hands and game state
- **Redis Sets**: Available moves and valid actions
- **Redis Sorted Sets**: Leaderboards and rankings
- **Redis Streams**: Game move history (temporary)

## 📊 **Monitoring and Metrics**

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Game State Access Time**: Redis operation latency
- **Data Synchronization Lag**: Redis → PostgreSQL delay
- **Cache Hit Ratio**: Effectiveness of caching strategy
- **Error Rate**: Synchronization and access failures

### Alerting Thresholds
- Redis latency > 5ms
- PostgreSQL latency > 100ms
- Synchronization lag > 30 seconds
- Error rate > 1%
