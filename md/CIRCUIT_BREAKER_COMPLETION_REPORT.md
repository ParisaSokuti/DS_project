## Configuration Summary

### Production Settings
```python
CircuitBreakerConfig(
    failure_threshold=10,      # Open after 10 failures
    success_threshold=5,       # Need 5 successes to close
    timeout=120.0,            # Wait 2 minutes before retry
    time_window=600.0,        # 10-minute failure tracking
    max_retry_attempts=5,     # Up to 5 retry attempts
    base_backoff_delay=2.0,   # Start with 2s delay
    max_backoff_delay=60.0    # Maximum 60s delay
)
```

### Development Settings
```python
CircuitBreakerConfig(
    failure_threshold=3,       # Open after 3 failures
    success_threshold=2,       # Need 2 successes to close
    timeout=30.0,             # Wait 30s before retry
    time_window=120.0,        # 2-minute failure tracking
    max_retry_attempts=2,     # Up to 2 retry attempts
    base_backoff_delay=0.5,   # Start with 500ms delay
    max_backoff_delay=5.0     # Maximum 5s delay
