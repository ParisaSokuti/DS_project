# Input Handling Fix Summary

## Problem Analysis

The user was experiencing an issue where the client would display connection recovery options but not accept any input, leaving the terminal unresponsive.

### What Was Happening

1. **User typed 'exit'** during gameplay
2. **Client preserved session** and exited cleanly  
3. **User restarted client** which found the preserved session
4. **Client attempted reconnection** using the stored player ID
5. **Server returned "Player not found in room"** error (likely because the game ended or server was restarted)
6. **Client displayed recovery options** but became unresponsive to input

### Root Causes

#### 1. **Incorrect Retry Logic**
```python
# WRONG - was trying to get terminal session ID instead of player ID
session_player_id = get_terminal_session_id()
if session_player_id:
    await ws.send(json.dumps({
        "type": "reconnect", 
        "player_id": session_player_id  # This was wrong!
    }))
```

The retry option was calling `get_terminal_session_id()` which returns a session filename (like `.player_session_86e4a804`), not the actual player ID that should be sent to the server.

#### 2. **Poor Input Loop Control**
The input handling loop didn't have proper flow control, making it unclear when to exit the loop and continue with the main message processing.

#### 3. **Ambiguous Empty Input Handling**
The original code treated empty input (`''`) the same as 'exit', which was confusing since the prompt offered "Press Enter to continue".

### The Fix

#### 1. **Fixed Retry Logic**
```python
# FIXED - now reads actual player ID from session file
try:
    if os.path.exists(SESSION_FILE):
        with open(SESSION_FILE, 'r') as f:
            stored_player_id = f.read().strip()
        if stored_player_id:
            await ws.send(json.dumps({
                "type": "reconnect",
                "player_id": stored_player_id,  # Correct player ID
                "room_code": room_code
            }))
```

#### 2. **Improved Input Loop Control**
```python
input_received = False
while not input_received:
    # ... handle input ...
    if valid_choice:
        input_received = True
        break
```

Added a clear flag to control when the input loop should exit.

#### 3. **Clarified Empty Input Handling**
```python
elif choice == '' or choice == 'enter':
    print("Continuing with current connection...")
    input_received = True
    break  # Continue with the main message loop
```

Now empty input (pressing Enter) properly continues with the connection instead of exiting.

#### 4. **Added Debug Output**
```python
print(f"[DEBUG] Connection error handler - User input: '{choice}'")
```

Added debug output to help trace input handling issues.

#### 5. **Fixed Formatting Issue**
Fixed a line formatting issue in the turn_start input prompt that was causing display problems.

## How to Test the Fix

1. **Start the server**: `python -m backend.server`
2. **Start a client and join a game**
3. **Type 'exit' to preserve session**
4. **Restart the server** (to clear the game state)
5. **Restart the client** - it should try to reconnect and fail
6. **Verify input handling works** - you should be able to type responses to the connection error options

## Prevention

To avoid this issue in the future:
- Always test input handling in error scenarios
- Use proper flow control flags in input loops  
- Distinguish between different types of session data
- Add debug output for troubleshooting input issues
- Test edge cases like empty input and invalid choices
