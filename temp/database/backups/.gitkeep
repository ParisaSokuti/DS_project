# Database Backups Directory

This directory is used for storing database backups during deployment and rollback operations.

## Backup Types

- **Pre-deployment backups**: Created automatically before each deployment
- **Scheduled backups**: Created on a regular schedule (hourly for production, daily for staging)
- **Manual backups**: Created on-demand for maintenance or testing
- **Emergency backups**: Created before rollback operations

## File Naming Convention

```
backup_{environment}_{type}_{timestamp}.{format}
```

Examples:
- `backup_production_pre_deploy_20240115_143000.sql`
- `backup_staging_scheduled_20240115_120000.sql`
- `backup_development_manual_20240115_100000.sql`

## Retention Policy

- **Development**: 7 days
- **Testing**: 3 days  
- **Staging**: 14 days
- **Production**: 30 days (with long-term archival to S3)

## Storage

- **Local development**: Stored in this directory
- **Staging/Production**: Stored in S3 with encryption
- **Archive**: Long-term storage in S3 Glacier

## Security

- All backups are compressed and encrypted
- Encryption keys are managed separately
- Access is logged and audited

## Cleanup

Old backups are automatically cleaned up based on retention policies:

```bash
# Manual cleanup
python database/rollback.py cleanup
```
