# User Instructions for Testing the Input Handling Fix

## Current Situation
The user is seeing the connection error recovery options and **CAN NOW ENTER INPUT** (the fix is working!):

```
What would you like to do? (exit/clear_session/retry/enter): 
```

## Recommended Action
Since the reconnection failed with "Player not found in room", the game likely ended when you exited as the hakem. 

**Type: `clear_session`**

This will:
1. Remove the invalid session file (`.player_session_8ede6116`)
2. Exit the client
3. When you restart, you'll join as a fresh player

## Alternative Actions

### Option 1: Press Enter
- Continues with current connection
- Will try to join as a new player in the existing game state
- May work if the game is still active

### Option 2: Type 'exit' 
- Exits and preserves the (invalid) session
- Not recommended since the session is already invalid

### Option 3: Type 'retry'
- Attempts reconnection again
- Will likely fail again with the same error since the game has ended

## Why This Shows the Fix is Working

1. **✅ Input is being accepted** - You were able to type 'retry' successfully
2. **✅ Debug output confirms processing** - `[DEBUG] Connection error handler - User input: 'retry'`
3. **✅ No infinite loop** - The client returned to the prompt after retry failed
4. **✅ Proper error handling** - Clear options and user control

## Next Steps
1. Type `clear_session` at the current prompt
2. Restart the client: `python -m backend.client`
3. You should join as a fresh player without any session issues

The input handling fix is working correctly!
