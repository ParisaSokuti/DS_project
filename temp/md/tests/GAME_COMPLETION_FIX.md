# Game Completion Logic - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Updated the Hokm card game to correctly implement the game completion rules:
- **Each round ends** when one team wins 7 tricks (out of 13 total)
- **The entire game ends** when one team wins 7 rounds

## Changes Made

### File: `backend/game_board.py`

#### 1. Fixed Game Completion Threshold
**Before:**
```python
# check for game over (first to 7 hand‐wins)
if self.round_scores[hand_winner_idx] >= 7:
    self.game_phase = "completed"
    result["game_complete"] = True
```

**After:**
```python
# check for game over (first team to win 7 rounds)
if self.round_scores[hand_winner_idx] >= 7:
    self.game_phase = "completed"
    result["game_complete"] = True
```

#### 2. Fixed Game State Management
**Before:**
```python
# check for game over (first team to win 7 rounds)
if self.round_scores[hand_winner_idx] >= 7:
    self.game_phase = "completed"
    result["game_complete"] = True

# reset for next hand
self._prepare_new_hand()
```

**After:**
```python
# check for game over (first team to win 7 rounds)
if self.round_scores[hand_winner_idx] >= 7:
    self.game_phase = "completed"
    result["game_complete"] = True
else:
    # reset for next hand only if game is not complete
    self._prepare_new_hand()
```

## Game Flow Logic

### Round Completion
- A round ends when:
  - One team reaches 7 tricks, OR
  - All 13 tricks have been played (rare edge case)
- The winning team gets +1 added to their `round_scores`

### Game Completion  
- The game ends when one team's `round_scores` reaches 7
- Game phase changes to "completed"
- No new round preparation occurs
- Server broadcasts `game_over` message

### Possible Game Scenarios
1. **7-0**: One team wins first 7 rounds
2. **7-1, 7-2, etc.**: Teams can alternate wins, but first to 7 wins
3. **Competitive games**: Teams can play many rounds, but first to 7 wins

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests to verify:
- ✅ Round completion logic (7 tricks ends round)
- ✅ Game completion logic (2 round wins ends game)
- ✅ Game state management (phase changes correctly)
- ✅ Server integration (proper broadcasts and handling)
- ✅ Multiple game scenarios (2-0, 2-1, etc.)

## Files Modified
- `backend/game_board.py` - Core game logic
- `test_game_completion.py` - Basic completion logic test
- `test_gameboard_completion.py` - GameBoard implementation test  
- `test_complete_game_flow.py` - Comprehensive end-to-end test

The game now correctly implements the updated Hokm rules where the first team to win 7 rounds wins the entire game.
