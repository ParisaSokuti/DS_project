## 🚀 **HOW TO PLAY RIGHT NOW**

### **1. Server is Already Running** ✅
- Server is active on `ws://localhost:8765`
- Ready to accept 4 players

### **2. Start Playing (4 Human Players)**
Open **4 separate terminals** and run this command in each:

```bash
cd "/Users/parisasokuti/my git repo/DS_project"
python -m backend.client
```

**That's it!** Players will automatically:
- Join room 9999
- Get assigned to teams
- Start playing when 4th player connects

## 🎮 **GAME FLOW**

1. **4 players join** → Teams assigned automatically (Team 1 vs Team 2)
2. **Initial 5 cards dealt** → Hakem (team leader) chooses hokm (trump suit)
3. **Remaining 8 cards dealt** → 13-trick gameplay begins
4. **Players take turns** → Must follow suit if possible
5. **Hand completion** → Team with most tricks wins the hand
6. **Game continues** → First team to win 7 hands wins the game!

## ⚠️ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **"Player not found in room" Error**
This indicates a synchronization issue between the server and Redis. To fix:

1. **Quick Fix**: Type `exit` in the affected client and rejoin:
   ```bash
   # In the client that got the error, type: exit
   # Then restart that client:
   python -m backend.client
   ```

2. **If error persists**: Restart the entire game:
   ```bash
   # Stop server (Ctrl+C), then restart:
   python -m backend.server
   
   # All players restart clients:
   python -m backend.client
   ```

### **Server Connection Issues**
- Ensure Redis is running: `redis-server`
- Check if port 8765 is available: `lsof -i :8765`
- Restart server if it becomes unresponsive

### **Game State Recovery**
The game automatically saves state to Redis, so disconnected players can usually rejoin mid-game.
