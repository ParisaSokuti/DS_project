# WebSocket Timeout Configuration Update

## Summary

Successfully increased WebSocket timeouts from 10 seconds to **5 minutes (300 seconds)** for improved reliability and reduced "no close frame received or sent" errors.

## Changes Made

### 1. Server Configuration Updates

**Files Updated:**
- `backend/server.py` - Main game server
- `backend/minimal_server.py` - Minimal test server  
- `minimal_server.py` - Root minimal server
- `example_server_integration.py` - Example server
- `enhanced_server_integration.py` - Enhanced server

**New Configuration:**
```python
async with websockets.serve(
    handle_connection, 
    "0.0.0.0", 
    8765,
    ping_interval=60,      # Send ping every 60 seconds
    ping_timeout=300,      # 5 minutes timeout for ping response
    close_timeout=300,     # 5 minutes timeout for close handshake
    max_size=1024*1024,    # 1MB max message size
    max_queue=100          # Max queued messages
):
```

### 2. Client Configuration Updates

**Files Updated:**
- `backend/client.py` - Main game client
- `test_redis_fix.py` - Test client

**New Configuration:**
```python
async with websockets.connect(
    SERVER_URI,
    ping_interval=60,      # Send ping every 60 seconds
    ping_timeout=300,      # 5 minutes timeout for ping response
    close_timeout=300,     # 5 minutes timeout for close handshake
    max_size=1024*1024,    # 1MB max message size
    max_queue=100          # Max queued messages
) as ws:
```

## Configuration Details

| Parameter | Old Value | New Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| `ping_interval` | 20s | 60s | How often to send ping frames |
| `ping_timeout` | 10s | 300s (5 min) | How long to wait for ping response |
| `close_timeout` | 10s | 300s (5 min) | How long to wait for close handshake |
| `max_size` | - | 1MB | Maximum message size |
| `max_queue` | - | 100 | Maximum queued messages |

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Connection Drops**: 5-minute timeout allows for network instability and slow responses
2. **Better User Experience**: Players won't be disconnected during thinking time
3. **Improved Reliability**: Handles slow network conditions and temporary disconnections
4. **Consistent Configuration**: All servers and clients use the same timeout settings

## Testing

- ✅ Server starts successfully with new configuration
- ✅ Client connects successfully with new configuration  
- ✅ WebSocket connection maintained for extended periods
- ✅ Timeout configuration verified with test script

## Impact on "no close frame received or sent" Error

This error typically occurs when:
- Client disconnects without proper WebSocket close handshake
- Network timeout occurs before close handshake completes
- Connection is terminated abruptly

**Resolution**: With 5-minute timeouts, the connection has much more time to complete proper close handshakes, significantly reducing this error.

## Redis Timeouts (Unchanged)

Redis operation timeouts remain unchanged at 5 seconds as they are appropriate for database operations:
- `operation_timeout`: 5.0s (Redis operations)
- `connection_timeout`: 30s (Redis connection establishment)

These shorter timeouts are intentional for database operations to avoid hanging on Redis issues.
