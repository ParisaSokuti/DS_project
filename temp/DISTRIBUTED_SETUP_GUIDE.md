# Distributed Server Setup Guide
## High Availability Hokm Game with Two Machines

### Network Configuration
- **Primary Server**: Your machine (localhost)
- **Secondary Server**: Friend's machine (192.168.1.92)
- **Load Balancer**: Your machine (port 8760)
- **Both machines must be on the same WiFi network**

---

## Setup Instructions

### On Your Machine (Primary Server + Load Balancer)

#### 1. Start Primary Server
```bash
cd c:\Users\kasra\hokm_game
python backend/server.py --port 8765 --instance-name primary
```

#### 2. Start Load Balancer
```bash
cd c:\Users\kasra\hokm_game
python backend/load_balancer.py
```

#### 3. Start Redis Monitor (Optional)
```bash
cd c:\Users\kasra\hokm_game
python backend/redis_monitor.py
```

### On Friend's Machine (192.168.1.92) - Secondary Server

#### 1. Install Requirements
Make sure your friend has the same project setup:
```bash
# Copy the entire hokm_game folder to friend's machine
# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 2. Configure Server for Network Access
Your friend needs to modify the server to listen on all interfaces.

Create this file on friend's machine: `start_secondary_server.py`
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Secondary server startup script for network access
"""
import asyncio
import sys
import os

# Add the backend directory to Python path
sys.path.append(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'backend'))

from server import GameServer

async def main():
    # Start server on all interfaces (0.0.0.0) so it's accessible from network
    server = GameServer(port=8765, instance_name="secondary")
    
    # Modify the server to listen on all interfaces
    print("ðŸš€ Starting Secondary Server on 192.168.1.92:8765")
    print("ðŸ“¡ Accessible from network")
    
    # Start the server
    await server.start(host="0.0.0.0")  # Listen on all interfaces

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

#### 3. Start Secondary Server
```bash
cd hokm_game
python start_secondary_server.py
```

### Network Configuration Notes

#### Firewall Settings (Important!)
Your friend's machine needs to allow incoming connections on port 8765:

**Windows Firewall:**
1. Open Windows Defender Firewall
2. Click "Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall"
3. Click "Change Settings" â†’ "Allow another app"
4. Browse to Python executable and add it
5. Make sure both "Private" and "Public" are checked

**Alternative: Create specific rule:**
```cmd
# Run as Administrator
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Hokm Game Server" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=8765
```

#### Network Testing
Test the connection from your machine:
```bash
# Test if friend's server is reachable
telnet 192.168.1.92 8765
# Or use PowerShell
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 192.168.1.92 -Port 8765
```

## Testing the Setup

### 1. Verify Both Servers
- Primary server running on your machine (localhost:8765)
- Secondary server running on friend's machine (192.168.1.92:8765)
- Load balancer running on your machine (localhost:8760)

### 2. Start Clients
All clients connect to the load balancer on your machine:
```bash
cd c:\Users\kasra\hokm_game
python backend/client.py
```

### 3. Test Failover
1. Start a game with multiple players
2. While playing, stop the primary server (Ctrl+C)
3. Load balancer should detect failure and migrate to secondary server
4. Game should continue on friend's machine

---

## Expected Behavior

âœ… **Normal Operation:**
- New clients connect to primary server (your machine)
- Load balancer shows: ðŸŸ¢primary(X) ðŸŸ¢secondary(0)

âœ… **During Failover:**
- Primary server fails
- Load balancer detects failure within 2-4 seconds
- Existing connections migrate to secondary server (friend's machine)
- New connections go to secondary server
- Load balancer shows: ðŸ”´primary(0) ðŸŸ¢secondary(X)

âœ… **Recovery:**
- Restart primary server
- New connections go back to primary
- Existing connections stay on secondary until they reconnect

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Connection Refused to 192.168.1.92:8765**
   - Check firewall settings on friend's machine
   - Verify server is listening on 0.0.0.0, not just localhost
   - Test with `telnet 192.168.1.92 8765`

2. **Load Balancer Can't Reach Secondary**
   - Verify IP address is correct: `ping 192.168.1.92`
   - Check if port 8765 is open on friend's machine
   - Make sure both machines are on same WiFi network

3. **Migration Not Working**
   - Check load balancer logs for migration messages
   - Verify Redis is running on primary machine
   - Ensure secondary server has access to same Redis instance

### Network Diagnostics:
```bash
# On your machine, test connectivity
ping 192.168.1.92
telnet 192.168.1.92 8765

# Check if load balancer can see secondary server
# Look for "âœ… Server secondary is now healthy" in load balancer logs
```

## Advanced: Shared Redis Setup

For best results, both servers should use the same Redis instance. You can either:

1. **Use Redis on your machine** (easier):
   - Friend's server connects to your Redis: `redis://YOUR_IP:6379`

2. **Set up Redis cluster** (more robust):
   - Run Redis on both machines with replication
