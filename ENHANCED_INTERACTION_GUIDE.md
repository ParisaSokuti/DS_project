# üéÆ Enhanced Card Interaction System

## Overview
The Hokm card game now features a comprehensive mouse and keyboard interaction system with drag-and-drop functionality, hover effects, and enhanced visual feedback.

## üéØ New Features Implemented

### 1. **Hover Effects**
- **Mouse Hover Detection**: Cards automatically detect when the mouse is hovering over them
- **Visual Feedback**: Hovered cards rise slightly (10 pixels) and show a blue highlight border
- **Smooth Transitions**: Hover effects provide immediate visual feedback for better user experience

### 2. **Drag and Drop System**
- **Click and Drag**: Click on any card and drag it around the screen
- **Visual Drag Feedback**: 
  - Dragged cards show transparency (alpha = 230)
  - Shadow effect follows the dragged card
  - Yellow highlight border around dragged cards
  - Ghost placeholder shows original position
- **Drop Zone Detection**: Center table area glows green when dragging cards over it
- **Smart Drop Handling**: Cards snap back to hand if dropped in invalid areas

### 3. **Enhanced Card Selection**
- **Pulsing Highlights**: Selected cards show animated yellow pulsing borders
- **Multiple Selection Methods**: 
  - Click to select
  - Keyboard navigation (arrow keys)
  - Number keys (1-9) for direct selection
- **Audio Feedback**: Different sounds for selection, playing, and returning cards

### 4. **Improved Visual Feedback**
- **Playable Card Indicators**: Subtle green glow shows which cards can be played
- **State-Based Highlighting**: Different colors for selected, hovered, and playable states
- **Animation Effects**: Smooth transitions and pulsing animations
- **Drop Zone Visualization**: Dynamic highlighting of valid drop areas

### 5. **Enhanced Controls**
- **ESC Key**: Cancels active drag operations
- **Space Bar**: Plays selected card
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate between cards
- **Mouse Controls**: Full click, drag, and drop support

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### New State Variables
```python
# Drag and drop state
self.dragging_card = False
self.dragged_card_index = -1
self.drag_offset = (0, 0)
self.mouse_pos = (0, 0)
self.hover_card_index = -1
self.drag_start_pos = (0, 0)
```

### Key Methods Added

#### `start_drag(card_index, mouse_pos)`
- Initiates drag operation
- Calculates mouse offset from card corner
- Sets drag state variables
- Provides audio feedback

#### `end_drag(mouse_pos)`
- Handles drop operations
- Validates drop zones
- Either plays card or returns to hand
- Resets drag state

#### `update_hover_state()`
- Continuously checks mouse position
- Updates hover card index
- Provides real-time hover feedback

#### `is_mouse_over_drop_zone()`
- Checks if mouse is over valid play area
- Used for drop zone highlighting
- Returns boolean for drop validation

### Enhanced Drawing System

#### `draw_cards_in_hand()` - Enhanced
- **Ghost Placeholders**: Shows transparent outline where dragged card originated
- **Layered Rendering**: Dragged cards drawn on top of everything else
- **Multiple Highlight Types**: Selected, hovered, and playable card indicators
- **Dynamic Positioning**: Hovered cards rise above others

#### `draw_played_cards_placeholders()` - Enhanced
- **Drop Zone Highlighting**: Green pulsing effect when dragging
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of where cards can be dropped
- **Animation Effects**: Smooth pulsing and highlighting

## üéÆ User Experience Improvements

### Interaction Flow
1. **Hover**: Move mouse over cards to see immediate visual feedback
2. **Select**: Click on a card to select it (pulsing yellow highlight)
3. **Drag**: Click and drag cards to move them around
4. **Drop**: Drop cards on the center table to play them
5. **Cancel**: Press ESC to cancel drag operations

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Selected Cards**: Bright yellow pulsing border
- **Hovered Cards**: Blue border + raised position
- **Playable Cards**: Subtle green glow
- **Dragged Cards**: Shadow + transparency + yellow border
- **Drop Zones**: Green pulsing highlight when active

### Audio Feedback
- **Card Selection**: "card_flip" sound at 30% volume
- **Card Playing**: "card_place" sound at 50% volume
- **Card Return**: "card_flip" sound at 20% volume
- **Drag Start**: "card_flip" sound at 40% volume

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Card Interaction
```python
# Hover over cards - automatic visual feedback
# Click to select - pulsing highlight appears
# Click again or drag to center to play
```

### Drag and Drop
```python
# Click and hold on a card
# Drag to center table (green highlight appears)
# Release to play the card
# Or drag elsewhere and release to cancel
```

### Keyboard Controls
```python
# Arrow keys to navigate cards
# Number keys (1-9) for direct selection
# SPACE to play selected card
# ESC to cancel drag operations
```

## üîß Testing

### Running the Demo
```bash
# Run the basic game
python hokm_gui_client.py

# Run the interactive demo
python interactive_demo.py

# Run the feature test
python test_interaction_features.py
```

### Features to Test
1. **Hover Effects**: Move mouse over cards
2. **Selection**: Click cards to see pulsing highlights
3. **Drag and Drop**: Drag cards to center table
4. **Drop Zones**: Watch for green highlighting
5. **Cancel Operations**: Use ESC key during drag
6. **Keyboard Navigation**: Use arrow keys and SPACE
7. **Audio Feedback**: Listen for different sound cues

## üìà Performance Considerations

- **Efficient Collision Detection**: Only checks active card positions
- **Optimized Rendering**: Minimal overdraw with layered rendering
- **Smooth Animations**: 60 FPS target maintained
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of drag states

## üé® Visual Design

- **Consistent Color Scheme**: Green table, yellow selection, blue hover
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Different effects for different states
- **Smooth Animations**: Pulsing and movement effects
- **Professional Polish**: Shadows, transparency, and borders

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Potential areas for further improvement:
